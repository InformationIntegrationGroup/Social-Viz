Path of workspace

My work is located at "src\Chen Qian\".
There are to folders under it.
1) socialVis 
	contains formated json file, js and html documents.
2) translateJson-SocialVis
	is eclipse project, it transforms json file in the "socialVis\Cumulative" to "socialVis\formattedCumulative".
	If you want to run the Java program, you need to modify the absolute path of input and output url.
	The original url is like "C:\\wamp\\www\\d3Note\\socialVis\\xxx".

Running of HTML

Since the Javascript use XMLRequest, if you open the html file directly on Chrome it will cause cross domain problem.
You can install apache server and put all social-Vis file under www file.
Then you can have access to the html page through localhost.

The html file runs will on Firefox.
