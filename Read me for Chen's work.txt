Path of workspace

My work is located at "src\Chen Qian\".
There are to folders under it.
1) socialVis 
	contains formated json file, js and html documents.
2) translateJson-SocialVis
	is eclipse project, it transforms json file in the "socialVis\Cumulative" to "socialVis\formattedCumulative".
	If you want to run the Java program, you need to modify the absolute path of input and output url.
	The original url is like "C:\\wamp\\www\\d3Note\\socialVis\\xxx".

Running of HTML

Since the Javascript use XMLRequest, if you open the html file directly on Chrome it will cause cross domain problem.
You can install apache server and put all social-Vis file under www file.
Then you can have access to the html page through localhost.

The html file runs well on Firefox.

Version 07/11

Update:
1. Bar chart
Add bar chart to describe the color of nodes in each cluster.
Click on one of cluster, bar chart will show on the left bottom of web page. Each bar represents statistic of node's color for each day. 
If you click another cluster, the bar chart of that cluster will be shown.
If you click the shown cluster again, the bar chart will disappear.

2. Nodes' distribution
The idea to distribute nodes in the cluster is based on the times that node in its correct cluster, which is the color of node is same to the color of cluster.
Now nodes with bigger radius will distribute based the above rule, the higher the correct time of node, the closer to the center of cluster.

3. Color of edges
If you hover on one node, it will show the connected edges and neighbor of that node.
Now the edge's color is based on the weight of it.
The color from low to high is
red, pink, orange, yellow.
